🔐 Setup Instructions
Tag your release Push a tag like v1.0.0 to trigger the workflow:

bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
Add your NuGet API key

Go to your GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

Add a new secret named NUGET_API_KEY with your key from nuget.org

Ensure your .csproj includes:

xml
<GenerateDocumentationFile>true</GenerateDocumentationFile>
<PublishRepositoryUrl>true</PublishRepositoryUrl>
<EmbedUntrackedSources>true</EmbedUntrackedSources>
You now have a fully automated, tag-driven release pipeline that builds, tests, packs, and publishes your NuGet package with full Source Link and XML doc support. Want to add prerelease support or auto-versioning from Git tags next? I’ve got templates for that too.
